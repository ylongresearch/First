Apart from discovering data structure and make it high-level, it is also worthy to concern how to decompose our tasks so that we humans can approach the machine from our side. To this end, ontology engineering aims at refining the human knowledge into the nature, and conversely build complex high-level tasks onto it. However, the knowledge based ontology is not necessary visually related. Therefore, my target is to design ontology structure based on visual attributes learning, which bridges the gap between human taxonomy and pixel-level pattern classification. This involves the discussion about not only "how to design vision" but also the essential question of "what is vision."\\

So far, I have implemented several initial works that introduced the ideal of spacial-related attributes. Substantial experiments have shown promising results. Based on these achievements, my future works may focus on more challenging and complex attributes. Meanwhile, a large-scaled ontology project is on proposal as well.
